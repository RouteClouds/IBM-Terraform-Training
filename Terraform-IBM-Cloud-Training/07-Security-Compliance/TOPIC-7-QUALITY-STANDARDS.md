```hcl
# Enterprise security configuration example
resource "ibm_kms_key" "secrets_encryption_key" {
  instance_id  = var.key_protect_instance_id
  key_name     = "${var.project_name}-secrets-key"
  standard_key = false  # Root key for secrets encryption
  
  # Automated rotation policy
  rotation {
    interval_month = 3  # Quarterly rotation for enhanced security
  }
  
  # Dual authorization for production environments
  dual_auth_delete = var.environment == "production" ? true : false
}

# Secrets Manager integration
resource "ibm_sm_secret_group" "application_secrets" {
  instance_id = var.secrets_manager_instance_id
  name        = "${var.project_name}-app-secrets"
  description = "Application secrets for ${var.project_name}"
}
```
