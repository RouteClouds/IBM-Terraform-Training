## üé≠ **Part B: Scenario-Based Questions (5 scenarios)**

### **Scenario 1: Lock Conflict Resolution**

**Situation**: Your team member Alice started a `terraform apply` operation 30 minutes ago, and the lock is still held. Bob needs to make an urgent infrastructure change. The lock timeout is set to 10 minutes, but the operation appears stuck.

**Questions**:
1. What steps should Bob take to resolve this situation?
2. What information should Bob gather before taking action?
3. If Alice is unresponsive, what is the appropriate escalation procedure?

**Expected Answer**:
1. Bob should first try to contact Alice to check if the operation is still running or stuck
2. Bob should gather: lock information, Alice's operation status, urgency of his change, and approval for emergency unlock
3. Get approval from team lead/manager, use `terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID`, document the incident, and verify state consistency

### **Scenario 2: Drift Detection and Remediation**

**Situation**: The automated drift detection system has identified that someone manually added a security group rule allowing SSH access from 0.0.0.0/0 to a production database server. The drift severity score is 8 (high), and auto-remediation threshold is set to 3.

**Questions**:
1. What actions will the drift detection system take automatically?
2. What manual steps are required to resolve this drift?
3. How should the team prevent similar incidents in the future?

**Expected Answer**:
1. System will send high-severity alerts but not auto-remediate due to severity > threshold
2. Manual review required, security assessment, approval workflow, then manual remediation via Terraform
3. Implement stricter IAM policies, security training, change management processes, and monitoring alerts

### **Scenario 3: Backend Migration with Locking**

**Situation**: Your team needs to migrate from local state to remote state with locking enabled. You have existing infrastructure managed by Terraform with local state files.

**Questions**:
1. What is the correct sequence of steps for this migration?
2. What precautions should be taken during the migration?
3. How do you verify the migration was successful?

**Expected Answer**:
1. Setup COS bucket and Cloudant, configure backend in providers.tf, run `terraform init`, confirm migration
2. Backup local state, ensure no concurrent operations, test in non-production first, have rollback plan
3. Verify state integrity with `terraform plan`, test locking with concurrent operations, validate all team members can access

### **Scenario 4: Performance Optimization**

**Situation**: Your drift detection system is generating too many false positives and the Cloud Functions are timing out frequently. The team is experiencing alert fatigue.

**Questions**:
1. What configuration changes would you make to address these issues?
2. How would you optimize the drift detection algorithm?
3. What monitoring should be implemented to prevent future issues?

**Expected Answer**:
1. Increase severity threshold, adjust detection frequency, increase function timeout and memory
2. Improve change filtering, implement incremental detection, add resource type prioritization
3. Monitor function performance, alert frequency metrics, false positive rates, and team feedback

### **Scenario 5: Compliance and Audit**

**Situation**: Your organization requires complete audit trails for all infrastructure changes and must demonstrate compliance with SOC 2 requirements for state management.

**Questions**:
1. What IBM Cloud services and configurations are needed for compliance?
2. How would you implement comprehensive audit logging?
3. What reports and documentation are required for compliance?

**Expected Answer**:
1. Activity Tracker with extended retention, encrypted state storage, IAM access controls, monitoring
2. Enable all audit events, implement log retention policies, secure log storage, access monitoring
3. Access reports, change logs, compliance dashboards, incident documentation, security assessments
