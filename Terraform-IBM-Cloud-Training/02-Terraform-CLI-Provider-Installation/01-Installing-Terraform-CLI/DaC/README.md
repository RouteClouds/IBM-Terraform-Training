# Diagram as Code (DaC) - Terraform CLI Installation Visualization

This directory contains Python scripts that programmatically generate visual diagrams to illustrate Terraform CLI installation concepts, methods, and troubleshooting procedures. The diagrams are created using code, making them version-controlled, reproducible, and easily modifiable.

## Overview

The Diagram as Code approach for Terraform CLI installation allows us to:
- **Version Control Diagrams**: Track changes to visual materials alongside code
- **Automate Diagram Generation**: Create consistent, professional diagrams programmatically
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure all diagrams follow the same styling and branding
- **Enable Collaboration**: Multiple team members can contribute to diagram improvements
- **Facilitate Updates**: Easy to modify diagrams when installation procedures change

## Generated Diagrams

The `terraform_cli_diagrams.py` script generates the following visualizations:

### 1. Installation Methods by Operating System (`installation_methods.png`)
- Comprehensive overview of installation options for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Highlights recommended methods for each platform with star indicators
- Visual comparison of package managers vs manual installation approaches
- Includes Docker-based installation options for all platforms

### 2. Terraform Architecture and Components (`terraform_architecture.png`)
- Central Terraform CLI core with connected components
- CLI commands (init, plan, apply, destroy) and their relationships
- Provider plugin architecture showing IBM Cloud and other major providers
- Configuration files and state file management visualization
- Data flow arrows showing the relationship between components

### 3. Installation Workflow Process (`installation_workflow.png`)
- Step-by-step visual guide through the complete installation process
- 10-step workflow from download to validation
- Color-coded steps with time estimates
- Clear progression arrows showing the logical sequence
- Estimated completion time for planning purposes

### 4. Version Management Strategies (`version_management.png`)
- Comparison of different version management approaches
- tfenv for macOS/Linux vs manual management vs container-based solutions
- Terraform version timeline showing major releases
- Best practices box with version management recommendations
- Platform compatibility matrix for different tools

### 5. Troubleshooting Flowchart (`troubleshooting_flowchart.png`)
- Interactive decision tree for resolving common installation issues
- Yes/No decision points with specific solution paths
- Common problems: command not found, permission denied, provider download failures
- Specific commands and solutions for each issue type
- Clear visual flow from problem identification to resolution

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation
1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd Terraform-IBM-Cloud-Training/02-Terraform-CLI-Provider-Installation/01-Installing-Terraform-CLI/DaC
   ```

2. Activate the Python virtual environment (if using the main training environment):
   ```bash
   source ../../../diagram-env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Generating Diagrams
Run the diagram generation script:
```bash
python terraform_cli_diagrams.py
```

This will create a `generated_diagrams/` directory containing all the PNG files.

### Output
After running the script, you'll find the following files in the `generated_diagrams/` directory:
- `installation_methods.png`
- `terraform_architecture.png`
- `installation_workflow.png`
- `version_management.png`
- `troubleshooting_flowchart.png`

## Customization

### Modifying Diagrams
The Python script is designed to be easily customizable:

1. **Colors**: Modify the color schemes by changing the color values in the script
2. **Content**: Add or remove elements by modifying the data structures
3. **Layout**: Adjust positioning and sizing by changing coordinate values
4. **Styling**: Modify fonts, line styles, and other visual elements

### Adding New Diagrams
To add new diagrams:
1. Create a new function following the existing pattern
2. Add the function call to the `generate_all_diagrams()` function
3. Test the new diagram generation

### Example Customization
```python
# Change color scheme for installation methods
os_sections = [
    {'name': 'Windows', 'x': 2, 'color': '#your_color', 'methods': [...]},
    # ... more sections
]
```

## Integration with Training Materials

These diagrams are designed to be used in conjunction with:
- **Concept.md**: Theoretical explanations reference these visual aids
- **Lab-2.1.md**: Practical installation exercises that demonstrate the concepts shown
- **Presentations**: Ready-to-use visuals for instructor-led training
- **Documentation**: Enhanced documentation with visual explanations

## Best Practices

### For Instructors
- Generate fresh diagrams before each training session to ensure latest versions
- Use diagrams as discussion starters and concept reinforcement tools
- Encourage students to examine the code that generates the diagrams
- Relate diagram concepts to hands-on lab exercises

### For Students
- Study the diagrams alongside the theoretical concepts
- Try modifying the Python code to understand how diagrams are constructed
- Use the diagrams as reference materials during lab exercises
- Create your own diagrams for complex concepts you're learning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Permission Errors**: Make sure you have write permissions in the current directory
3. **Display Issues**: If running on a headless server, matplotlib might need backend configuration

### Solutions
```python
# For headless environments, add this at the top of the script:
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use non-interactive backend
```

## Technical Details

### Diagram Specifications
- **Resolution**: 300 DPI for high-quality printing and presentation
- **Format**: PNG for universal compatibility
- **Dimensions**: Optimized for 16:10 aspect ratio presentations
- **Color Scheme**: Professional colors with good contrast for accessibility

### Code Structure
- **Modular Functions**: Each diagram has its own generation function
- **Consistent Styling**: Shared color schemes and formatting across diagrams
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing directories and dependencies
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments explaining diagram logic

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
- **Interactive Diagrams**: Using libraries like Plotly for interactive visualizations
- **Animation**: Creating animated diagrams to show process flows
- **3D Visualizations**: For complex architecture representations
- **Integration**: Direct integration with presentation tools
- **Theming**: Support for different visual themes (dark mode, corporate branding)

## Contributing

1. Fork or branch the training repository
2. Modify the diagram generation scripts
3. Test the changes by generating new diagrams
4. Submit a pull request with your improvements
5. Include sample outputs and descriptions of changes
