### Integration with Learning Materials

#### Concept.md Integration
Each diagram is strategically referenced in the Concept.md file with:
- **Figure captions** explaining the diagram's purpose
- **Cross-references** linking diagrams to specific concepts
- **Learning objectives** that each diagram supports
- **Practical examples** that relate to the visual content

#### Lab Exercise Integration
Diagrams support hands-on learning by:
- **Visual guidance** for complex configuration patterns
- **Reference materials** during troubleshooting exercises
- **Architecture blueprints** for multi-tier deployments
- **Optimization targets** for performance improvement exercises

#### Assessment Integration
Diagrams are used in assessments for:
- **Visual analysis questions** requiring diagram interpretation
- **Architecture design challenges** using diagram patterns
- **Troubleshooting scenarios** based on dependency graphs
- **Optimization exercises** comparing before/after states

### Customization and Extension

#### Modifying Diagrams
To customize diagrams for specific needs:

```python
# Example: Changing colors
IBM_CUSTOM_BLUE = '#1f70fe'  # Custom blue variant
IBM_CUSTOM_GREEN = '#34b158'  # Custom green variant

# Example: Adding new elements
def add_custom_element(ax, x, y, text):
    create_rounded_box(ax, x, y, 20, 8, text, IBM_CUSTOM_BLUE)
```

#### Adding New Diagrams
To add additional diagrams:

1. Create new diagram function following the pattern:
```python
def diagram_6_new_concept():
    """Diagram 6: New Concept Visualization"""
    fig, ax = setup_diagram(title="New Concept", subtitle="Description")
    # Add diagram elements
    return fig
```

2. Add to the main generation loop:
```python
diagrams.append((diagram_6_new_concept, "06_new_concept.png"))
```

#### Batch Processing
For generating multiple versions or formats:

```bash
# Generate diagrams in different formats
python dependency_diagrams.py --format svg
python dependency_diagrams.py --format pdf
python dependency_diagrams.py --dpi 150  # Lower resolution for web
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'`
**Solution**: 
```bash
pip install matplotlib
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Issue**: Diagrams appear blurry or pixelated
**Solution**: Ensure DPI is set to 300 in the script:
```python
fig.savefig(filepath, dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
```

**Issue**: Colors don't match IBM brand guidelines
**Solution**: Verify color constants at the top of the script:
```python
IBM_BLUE = '#0f62fe'  # Correct IBM blue
```

**Issue**: File sizes are too large
**Solution**: Optimize PNG compression:
```python
fig.savefig(filepath, dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight', 
           optimize=True, pil_kwargs={'compress_level': 6})
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Generation Time
- **Single diagram**: 2-5 seconds
- **All diagrams**: 10-25 seconds
