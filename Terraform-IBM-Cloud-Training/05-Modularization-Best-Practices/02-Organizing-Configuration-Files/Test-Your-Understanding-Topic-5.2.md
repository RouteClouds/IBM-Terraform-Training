A) Duplicate all configurations for each region  
B) Hierarchical configuration with global, regional, and environment layers  
C) Single configuration file with complex conditionals  
D) Separate projects for each region

    error_message = "Organization name must start with uppercase letter and contain only letters, numbers, and spaces."
  }
  
  validation {
    condition = contains(["development", "staging", "production"], var.organization_config.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be development, staging, or production."
  }
  
  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^CC-[A-Z]{3}-[0-9]{3}$", var.organization_config.cost_center))
    error_message = "Cost center must follow format CC-XXX-000."
  }
}

variable "network_config" {
  description = "Network configuration with CIDR validation"
  type = object({
    vpc_cidr = string
    subnets  = list(object({
      cidr = string
      zone = string
    }))
  })
  
  validation {
    condition = can(cidrhost(var.network_config.vpc_cidr, 0))
    error_message = "VPC CIDR must be a valid CIDR block."
  }
  
  validation {
    condition = alltrue([
      for subnet in var.network_config.subnets :
      can(cidrhost(subnet.cidr, 0))
    ])
    error_message = "All subnet CIDRs must be valid CIDR blocks."
  }
}

variable "cost_budget" {
  description = "Monthly cost budget with environment-specific validation"
  type        = number
  
  validation {
    condition = var.cost_budget > 0 && var.cost_budget <= (
      var.organization_config.environment == "development" ? 1000 :
      var.organization_config.environment == "staging" ? 5000 :
      var.organization_config.environment == "production" ? 50000 : 1000
