## üéØ **Part 2: Scenario-Based Questions (5 points)**

### **Scenario 1** (1 point)
Your organization needs to deploy VPC infrastructure across multiple environments (dev, staging, production) with different configurations. The development environment needs 1 subnet, staging needs 2 subnets, and production needs 3 subnets with high availability.

**Question**: What is the best approach to handle this requirement using Terraform modules?

A) Create separate modules for each environment  
B) Use conditional logic with count or for_each based on environment variables  
C) Hardcode different configurations in each environment  
D) Use different Terraform providers for each environment  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Using conditional logic with variables allows a single module to handle different environment requirements while maintaining consistency and reducing code duplication.

---

### **Scenario 2** (1 point)
You're developing a module that creates IBM Cloud VPC resources. During testing, you discover that some variable combinations result in invalid CIDR blocks that cause deployment failures.

**Question**: What is the most effective way to prevent this issue?

A) Document the valid combinations in README  
B) Implement validation rules in variable definitions  
C) Use try() functions to handle errors  
D) Create separate variables for each valid combination  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Variable validation rules provide immediate feedback and prevent invalid configurations from being applied, improving user experience and preventing deployment failures.

---

### **Scenario 3** (1 point)
Your team is building a module library for IBM Cloud infrastructure. You need to ensure that modules can be easily discovered, versioned, and shared across multiple teams while maintaining quality standards.

**Question**: What is the most comprehensive approach to achieve this?

A) Store modules in a shared Git repository with tags  
B) Implement a private module registry with automated testing and governance  
C) Share modules via email attachments  
D) Use public GitHub repositories for all modules  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: A private module registry with automated testing, governance, and proper versioning provides the best solution for enterprise module management and distribution.

---

### **Scenario 4** (1 point)
You're creating a module that provisions compute instances in IBM Cloud VPC. The module should support both development (1 instance) and production (3+ instances with load balancing) use cases while maintaining cost efficiency.

**Question**: What design pattern best addresses this requirement?

A) Create two separate modules for dev and production  
B) Use variable-driven configuration with conditional resource creation  
C) Always create maximum resources and scale down manually  
D) Use different instance profiles for different environments  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Variable-driven configuration with conditional resource creation allows a single module to efficiently handle different deployment scenarios while optimizing costs.

---

### **Scenario 5** (1 point)
Your module creates VPC infrastructure and needs to provide connection information for other modules that will deploy applications. The consuming modules need VPC ID, subnet IDs, security group IDs, and network endpoints.

**Question**: What is the best practice for structuring module outputs?

A) Create individual outputs for each piece of information  
B) Use structured outputs with nested objects for logical grouping  
C) Store information in local files for other modules to read  
D) Use data sources in consuming modules to discover resources  

**Answer**: B

**Explanation**: Structured outputs with nested objects provide organized, comprehensive information that's easy for consuming modules to use while maintaining clear interfaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Part 3: Hands-on Challenges (5 points)**

### **Challenge 1: Module Interface Design** (2 points)

**Task**: Design a variable structure for a VPC module that supports the following requirements:
- VPC name with validation (3-63 characters, lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens)
- 1-5 subnets with zone, CIDR, and optional public gateway
- Optional security groups with custom rules
- Enterprise tagging with cost center and environment

**Deliverable**: Write the variable definitions with appropriate validation rules.

**Sample Solution**:
```hcl
variable "vpc_configuration" {
  description = "VPC configuration with validation"
  type = object({
    name = string
    subnets = list(object({
      name       = string
      zone       = string
      cidr_block = string
      public_gateway_enabled = optional(bool, false)
    }))
    security_groups = optional(list(object({
      name = string
      rules = list(object({
        direction = string
        protocol  = string
        port_min  = optional(number)
        port_max  = optional(number)
        source    = string
      }))
    })), [])
  })
  
  validation {
    condition = can(regex("^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$", var.vpc_configuration.name))
    error_message = "VPC name must be 3-63 characters, lowercase, alphanumeric with hyphens."
  }
  
  validation {
    condition = length(var.vpc_configuration.subnets) >= 1 && length(var.vpc_configuration.subnets) <= 5
    error_message = "Must have 1-5 subnets."
  }
}

variable "enterprise_tags" {
  description = "Enterprise tagging configuration"
  type = object({
    cost_center = string
    environment = string
    project     = string
  })
  
  validation {
    condition = contains(["development", "staging", "production"], var.enterprise_tags.environment)
    error_message = "Environment must be development, staging, or production."
  }
}
```

### **Challenge 2: Output Design** (2 points)

**Task**: Design comprehensive outputs for the VPC module that provide:
- Complete VPC information for integration
- Subnet details with zone mapping
- Security group information
- Cost tracking data
- Integration endpoints for other modules

**Deliverable**: Write the output definitions with proper descriptions and structure.

**Sample Solution**:
```hcl
output "vpc_infrastructure" {
  description = "Complete VPC infrastructure for integration"
  value = {
    vpc = {
      id   = ibm_is_vpc.main.id
      name = ibm_is_vpc.main.name
      crn  = ibm_is_vpc.main.crn
    }
    subnets = {
      for subnet in ibm_is_subnet.main : subnet.name => {
        id   = subnet.id
        zone = subnet.zone
        cidr = subnet.ipv4_cidr_block
      }
    }
    security_groups = {
      for sg in ibm_is_security_group.custom : sg.name => {
        id = sg.id
      }
    }
  }
}

output "integration_endpoints" {
  description = "Integration points for other modules"
  value = {
    vpc_id = ibm_is_vpc.main.id
    subnet_ids = [for subnet in ibm_is_subnet.main : subnet.id]
    security_group_ids = [for sg in ibm_is_security_group.custom : sg.id]
  }
}

output "cost_tracking" {
  description = "Cost allocation and tracking information"
  value = {
    resource_count = {
      vpc_count    = 1
      subnet_count = length(ibm_is_subnet.main)
      sg_count     = length(ibm_is_security_group.custom)
    }
    cost_allocation = var.enterprise_tags
    estimated_monthly_cost = {
      vpc_cost = 0.00
      total_cost = 0.00
    }
  }
}
```
