## Integration with Educational Content

### **Strategic Placement**
Each diagram is strategically placed within the Concept.md content to:
- **Introduce concepts** with visual overview before detailed explanation
- **Reinforce learning** through visual representation of complex relationships
- **Provide reference** for hands-on lab exercises and practical implementation
- **Support different learning styles** with visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches

### **Figure Captions and References**
All diagrams include professional figure captions that:
- **Describe the diagram's purpose** and educational value
- **Highlight key learning points** and relationships shown
- **Connect to surrounding content** and cross-reference related sections
- **Provide context** for practical application and real-world usage

### **Cross-Reference System**
Diagrams are integrated with:
- **Lab exercises** that implement the concepts shown visually
- **Assessment questions** that test understanding of visual concepts
- **Future topics** that build upon the foundational patterns established
- **Enterprise examples** that demonstrate real-world application

## Maintenance and Updates

### **Version Control**
- All diagram source code is version controlled for reproducibility
- Generated diagrams are included in repository for immediate availability
- Changes to diagrams require regeneration and validation of educational integration

### **Quality Assurance**
- Visual consistency checked across all diagrams
- Educational alignment verified with learning objectives
- Professional quality validated for enterprise training environments
- Accessibility compliance ensured for diverse learning needs

### **Update Procedures**
1. **Modify Python script** with required changes
2. **Regenerate all diagrams** to maintain consistency
3. **Update figure references** in Concept.md if needed
4. **Validate integration** with lab exercises and assessments
5. **Test display quality** across different devices and formats

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError` for matplotlib or other dependencies
- **Solution**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and requirements are installed
- **Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Low resolution or blurry diagrams
- **Solution**: Verify DPI setting is 300 in the script
- **Check**: Generated files should be approximately 4800x3600 pixels

**Issue**: Missing generated_diagrams directory
- **Solution**: Script creates directory automatically, check file permissions
- **Manual**: `mkdir -p generated_diagrams`

**Issue**: Color inconsistency across diagrams
- **Solution**: Verify IBM brand color constants are used consistently
- **Check**: All diagrams should use the same color palette

### **Support and Feedback**

For technical issues or educational feedback:
- Review the troubleshooting section above
- Check that all prerequisites are properly installed
- Verify Python version compatibility (3.8+)
- Ensure all dependencies are up to date
