## üéØ **Section B: Scenario-Based Questions (5 points)**

### **Scenario 1** (2 points)
Your team is implementing a multi-environment Terraform setup for a web application. You need to organize the project to support development, staging, and production environments while maintaining code reusability and security.

**Question**: Design a directory structure that supports this requirement. Explain how you would organize the files and what considerations you would make for each environment.

**Answer Guidelines**:
- Describe directory organization approach
- Explain file separation strategy
- Address security considerations
- Discuss variable management across environments

### **Scenario 2** (1.5 points)
A developer on your team has created a Terraform configuration but is experiencing validation errors. The configuration includes hardcoded values, missing variable descriptions, and no validation rules.

**Question**: Identify the issues and provide specific recommendations for improving the configuration following enterprise best practices.

- Identify specific issues with hardcoded values
- Recommend variable validation improvements
- Suggest documentation enhancements
- Propose security improvements

### **Scenario 3** (1.5 points)
Your organization wants to implement cost optimization for their IBM Cloud Terraform deployments. The current configuration creates public gateways for all environments, even when internet access isn't required.

**Question**: Propose a solution that allows flexible public gateway configuration while maintaining cost efficiency. Include specific variable and resource modifications.

**Answer Guidelines**:
- Propose variable-driven public gateway configuration
- Explain cost implications
- Suggest environment-specific defaults
- Recommend monitoring approaches
