# IBM CLOUD AUTHENTICATION AND CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# IBM Cloud API Key (Required)
# Obtain from: https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys
# Set as environment variable: export IC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# Or uncomment and set the value below:
# ibmcloud_api_key = "your-ibm-cloud-api-key-here"

# IBM Cloud Region (Required)
# Available regions: us-south, us-east, eu-gb, eu-de, eu-es, jp-tok, jp-osa, au-syd, br-sao, ca-tor
# Choose the region closest to your users or based on compliance requirements
ibm_region = "us-south"

# Resource Group (Required)
# Must exist in your IBM Cloud account
# Use "default" if you haven't created custom resource groups
resource_group_name = "default"

# =============================================================================
# PROJECT CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Project name for resource naming and tagging
# Used as prefix for all resource names
# Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
# Length: 3-20 characters
project_name = "terraform-lab"

# Environment designation
# Valid values: dev, test, staging, prod, production
# Used for resource organization and lifecycle management
environment = "dev"

# Owner information for resource tagging and accountability
# Can be email address or team name
# Used for resource ownership tracking and billing
owner = "your-email@company.com"

# Cost center or department code for billing and resource allocation
# Used for cost tracking and departmental billing
cost_center = "engineering"

# =============================================================================
# NETWORK CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# VPC CIDR block (adjust if conflicts with existing networks)
# Must be a valid IPv4 CIDR with /16 or larger prefix
# Default provides ~65,000 IP addresses
vpc_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/16"

# Subnet CIDR blocks (must be within VPC CIDR)
# Each subnet will be created in a different availability zone
# Default provides ~250 IP addresses per subnet
subnet_cidr_blocks = [
  "10.240.1.0/24",  # Subnet 1 - Zone 1
  "10.240.2.0/24",  # Subnet 2 - Zone 2
  "10.240.3.0/24"   # Subnet 3 - Zone 3
]

# Enable public gateway for internet access
# Set to false if you don't need internet access from private subnets
# Note: Public gateways incur charges ($45/month per gateway)
enable_public_gateway = true

# Enable VPC flow logs for network monitoring and security analysis
# Set to true for production environments or security compliance
# Note: Flow logs incur storage charges
enable_flow_logs = false

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# CIDR blocks allowed for SSH access (port 22)
# Use specific IP ranges for better security
# Example: ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"]
# Use ["0.0.0.0/0"] for open access (not recommended for production)
allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

# CIDR blocks allowed for HTTP/HTTPS access (ports 80/443)
# Use specific IP ranges for better security
# Use ["0.0.0.0/0"] for public web access
allowed_http_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

# Enable logging for security group rules
# Useful for compliance and security monitoring
enable_security_group_logging = false

# =============================================================================
# TAGGING AND METADATA
# =============================================================================

# Additional resource tags for organization and cost tracking
# Maximum 50 tags per resource
# Use consistent tagging strategy across your organization
resource_tags = {
  "managed-by"    = "terraform"
  "project-type"  = "infrastructure-automation"
  "training-lab"  = "directory-structure"
  "cost-center"   = "engineering"
  "team"          = "devops"
  "environment"   = "development"
}

# Enable detailed monitoring and logging for all resources
# Useful for production environments and troubleshooting
# May incur additional charges for monitoring services
enable_detailed_monitoring = false

# Number of days to retain backups and snapshots
# Adjust based on your backup and compliance requirements
# Valid range: 1-365 days
backup_retention_days = 7

# =============================================================================
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Specific availability zones to use (optional)
# If empty, will use all available zones in the region
# Example: ["us-south-1", "us-south-2"]
# Leave empty to automatically distribute across all zones
availability_zones = []

# Enable classic infrastructure access for hybrid connectivity
# Set to true if you need to connect to classic infrastructure
# Most new deployments should leave this as false
enable_classic_access = false

# Custom DNS servers for the VPC (optional)
# If empty, will use IBM Cloud default DNS servers
# Example: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
# Maximum 3 DNS servers
dns_servers = []

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
# =============================================================================

# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLE:
# project_name = "myapp-dev"
# environment = "dev"
# enable_public_gateway = true
# allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
# enable_detailed_monitoring = false

# STAGING ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLE:
# project_name = "myapp-staging"
# environment = "staging"
# enable_public_gateway = true
# allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24"]
# enable_detailed_monitoring = true

# PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLE:
# project_name = "myapp-prod"
# environment = "production"
# enable_public_gateway = false
# allowed_ssh_cidr_blocks = ["203.0.113.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"]
# enable_detailed_monitoring = true
# enable_flow_logs = true
# enable_security_group_logging = true

# =============================================================================
# COST OPTIMIZATION TIPS
# =============================================================================

# To minimize costs:
# - Set enable_public_gateway = false if internet access is not needed
# - Use specific CIDR blocks instead of 0.0.0.0/0 for better security
# - Set enable_detailed_monitoring = false for development environments
# - Use smaller subnet CIDR blocks if you don't need many IP addresses
# - Consider using reserved capacity for predictable workloads

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY BEST PRACTICES
# =============================================================================

# For production environments:
# - Use specific IP ranges for SSH and HTTP access
# - Enable flow logs and security group logging
# - Use strong, unique project names
# - Implement proper tagging strategy
# - Regular review and update of security group rules
# - Use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center for monitoring
