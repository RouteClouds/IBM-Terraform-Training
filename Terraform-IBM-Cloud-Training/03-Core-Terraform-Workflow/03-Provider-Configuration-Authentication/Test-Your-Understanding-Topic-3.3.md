B) Using environment variables (IC_API_KEY)  
C) Storing credentials in terraform.tfvars files  
D) Using inline variable declarations  

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Environment variables prevent credentials from being stored in configuration files and reduce the risk of accidental exposure.

## 🎯 **Part B: Scenario-Based Questions (40 points)**

### **Scenario 1: Multi-Environment Security Configuration** (8 points)

Your organization requires different security configurations for development, staging, and production environments:
- **Development**: Public endpoints, debug logging enabled, relaxed timeouts
- **Staging**: Public endpoints, debug logging disabled, moderate timeouts  
- **Production**: Private endpoints, no debug logging, conservative timeouts

**Question 1a** (4 points): Write the provider alias configurations for all three environments.

**Sample Answer**:
```hcl
# Development environment
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "dev"
  ibmcloud_api_key = var.dev_api_key
  region = var.dev_region
  ibmcloud_timeout = 60
  max_retries = 1
}

# Staging environment  
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "staging"
  ibmcloud_api_key = var.staging_api_key
  region = var.staging_region
  ibmcloud_timeout = 180
  max_retries = 2
}

# Production environment
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "prod"
  ibmcloud_api_key = var.prod_api_key
  region = var.prod_region
  ibmcloud_timeout = 300
  max_retries = 3
}
```

**Question 1b** (4 points): Explain the security rationale behind these different configurations and identify two additional security measures that should be implemented.

**Sample Answer**: Development uses relaxed settings for easier debugging, staging balances security with testing needs, and production uses the most secure configuration with private endpoints and no debug logging. Additional measures: 1) Implement separate IAM permissions for each environment, 2) Use external secret management for credential rotation.

### **Scenario 2: Regional Disaster Recovery Setup** (8 points)

Your company needs to implement disaster recovery across three regions: US South (primary), EU GB (secondary), and Asia Pacific (tertiary).

**Question 2a** (4 points): Design provider aliases for this multi-region setup with appropriate timeout optimizations.

**Sample Answer**:
```hcl
# Primary region (US South)
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "us_south"
  region = "us-south"
  ibmcloud_timeout = 180
  max_retries = 2
}

# Secondary region (EU GB)
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "eu_gb"
  region = "eu-gb"
  ibmcloud_timeout = 300
  max_retries = 3
}

# Tertiary region (Asia Pacific)
provider "ibm" {
  alias = "jp_tok"
  region = "jp-tok"
  ibmcloud_timeout = 360
  max_retries = 4
}
```

**Question 2b** (4 points): Explain why different timeout values are used for different regions and describe how this configuration supports disaster recovery objectives.

**Sample Answer**: Different timeout values account for varying network latency across regions - Asia Pacific has the highest timeout due to greater distance and potential latency. This configuration supports disaster recovery by enabling resource deployment across multiple regions, ensuring business continuity if one region becomes unavailable.

### **Scenario 3: Enterprise Authentication Strategy** (8 points)

An enterprise organization needs to implement secure authentication with the following requirements:
- Credential rotation every 90 days
- No credentials stored in configuration files
- Audit trail for all API access
- Integration with existing secret management system

**Question 3a** (4 points): Describe the authentication approach and provider configuration that meets these requirements.

**Sample Answer**: Use service IDs with external secret management (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager), configure provider to use environment variables, implement automated credential rotation, and enable audit logging through IBM Cloud Activity Tracker. Provider should use IC_API_KEY environment variable populated from secret management system.

**Question 3b** (4 points): Identify three specific security risks this approach mitigates and explain how.

**Sample Answer**: 1) Credential exposure in code - mitigated by using environment variables and external secret management, 2) Long-lived credentials - mitigated by 90-day rotation policy, 3) Unauthorized access - mitigated by audit trails and proper IAM permissions with service IDs.

### **Scenario 4: Performance Optimization Challenge** (8 points)

Your Terraform deployments are experiencing timeout issues in certain regions, and you need to optimize provider performance while maintaining security.

**Question 4a** (4 points): Design a provider configuration strategy that addresses performance issues while maintaining security standards.

**Sample Answer**: Implement region-specific timeout configurations, use appropriate retry strategies, configure connection pooling if available, and maintain private endpoints for production. Use performance monitoring to identify optimal timeout values for each region.

**Question 4b** (4 points): Explain how you would monitor and measure the effectiveness of these optimizations.

**Sample Answer**: Implement custom headers for request tracking, monitor API response times and success rates, use Terraform execution time metrics, and set up alerting for timeout failures. Track retry patterns and adjust configurations based on performance data.

### **Scenario 5: Troubleshooting Authentication Failures** (8 points)

A team is experiencing intermittent authentication failures with their IBM Cloud provider configuration, particularly during automated deployments.

**Question 5a** (4 points): Outline a systematic troubleshooting approach for diagnosing authentication issues.

**Sample Answer**: 1) Enable debug logging (TF_LOG=DEBUG), 2) Verify API key validity and permissions, 3) Check network connectivity and firewall rules, 4) Validate IAM permissions for required services, 5) Test authentication outside of Terraform, 6) Review rate limiting and quota issues.

**Question 5b** (4 points): Identify three common causes of intermittent authentication failures and their solutions.

**Sample Answer**: 1) Rate limiting - implement retry logic and request throttling, 2) Network connectivity issues - use private endpoints and configure appropriate timeouts, 3) Credential rotation conflicts - implement proper secret management and rotation coordination.
