**Issue**: Missing generated_diagrams directory
- **Solution**: Script creates directory automatically, check file permissions
- **Manual**: `mkdir -p generated_diagrams`

**Issue**: Provider configuration inconsistency across diagrams
- **Solution**: Verify provider patterns match actual IBM Cloud provider documentation
- **Check**: All diagrams should use consistent provider terminology and security patterns
