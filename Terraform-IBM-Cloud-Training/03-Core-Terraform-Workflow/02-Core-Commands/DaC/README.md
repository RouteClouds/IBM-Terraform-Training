## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError` for matplotlib or other dependencies
- **Solution**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and requirements are installed
- **Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Low resolution or blurry command diagrams
- **Solution**: Verify DPI setting is 300 in the script
- **Check**: Generated files should be approximately 4800x3600 pixels

**Issue**: Missing generated_diagrams directory
- **Solution**: Script creates directory automatically, check file permissions
- **Manual**: `mkdir -p generated_diagrams`

**Issue**: Command workflow inconsistency across diagrams
- **Solution**: Verify command sequences match actual Terraform behavior
- **Check**: All diagrams should use consistent command terminology and flow
